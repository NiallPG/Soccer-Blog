            Paris Saint-Germain is a club out of the French capital of Paris. Being based in Paris and wearing the Jordan logo as their sponsor, PSG are often considered the most fashionable club in the world. Despite playing in the weakest domestic league, PSG have had considerable recent success in the all-important champions league, though never winning it. They have owners with deep pockets, signing brazilian star Neymar in 2017 for a record fee of â‚¬222 million and have recently brought Messi to their club as well.
