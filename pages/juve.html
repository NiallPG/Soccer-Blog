            Juventus is the largest club in Italy. Based in Turin in the Piedmont region, “The Old Lady” is a domestically very successful club that has struggled recently. Having lost some of their star talent to other clubs and following the trend of letting players become coaches has led the club unusually astray. Juventus has for many years supplied the backbone of the Italian national team. Internationally the club usually makes it to the later rounds of the champions league but has been falling short as of late. The fans are usually seen as snobby and upper class due to the wealth of the Piedmont region.
