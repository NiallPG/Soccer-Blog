            Manchester United is historically the most successful club from England. They have won the champions league 3 times and their domestic league 20 times. Recently however, they have struggled to compete with other top tier clubs due to poor financial decisions and the investments in the wrong players. They are owned by the Glazer family, who also own the Buccaneers in the NFL, and have come under fire for their mismanagement of the club.
