            Real Madrid is the most successful club in the history of soccer. Founded in 1902, the Madrid based club has won every trophy there is to win and more. They have won the champions league, the most important competition in club soccer, a record 14 times as well as their own domestic league, La Liga, 35 times. You can think of them as a generationally dominant team like the Celtics or Lakers. Cristiano Ronaldo played for Madrid for the majority of his career. Madrid have a reputation for signing “galacticos”, galactic talents, in other words. They play out of the massive 81,000 capacity Santiago Bernabeu with a traditionally all white kit. If you are looking to support a team that will constantly be a strong contender no matter what, Real Madrid is your team.
