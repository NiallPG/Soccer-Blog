            Bayern Munich is the largest club from Germany. The club is based in the city of Munich in the German state of Bayern. They are the greatest domestic powerhouse in Europe having won nine straight league titles domestically and 32 overall. In addition to this, Bayern won the champions league in 2020, thrashing a Barcelona side with Lionel Messi 8-2 in the process. The mentality of the club massively reflects a German mentality towards football overall, with a focus on team chemistry over single talents and peak physicality. Like Juventus, the players on Bayern Munich will usually occupy lots of spots on the German national team.
