            Chelsea is one of the big four clubs based out of London, England. Though historically they were a middle of the table club, in 2003 Chelsea were bought by Russian billionaire oligarch Roman Abramovich and had their fortunes change. In the 19 years since, the club has won the champions league twice and the English league six times. The neighborhood of Chelsea is typically seen as an upper-class neighborhood in London and some believe their fans reflect that. They play at a relatively smaller stadium called Stamford Bridge, but the club has far reaching support due to their success.
